Question 1

What's the version of NumPy that you installed?

You can get the version information using the __version__ field:

np.__version__
Question 2

What's the version of Pandas?

Getting the data

For this homework, we'll use the same dataset as for the next session - the car price dataset.

Download it from here:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/master/chapter-02-car-price/data.csv

You can do it with wget:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/master/chapter-02-car-price/data.csv
Or just open it with your browser and click "Save as...".

Now read it with Pandas.

Question 3

What's the average price of BMW cars in the dataset?

Question 4

Select a subset of cars after year 2015 (inclusive, i.e. 2015 and after). How many of them have missing values for Engine HP?

Question 5

Calculate the average "Engine HP" in the dataset.
Use the fillna method and to fill the missing values in "Engine HP" with the mean value from the previous step.
Now, calcualte the average of "Engine HP" again.
Has it changed?
Round both means before answering this questions. You can use the round function for that:

print(round(mean_hp_before))
print(round(mean_hp_after))
Question 6

Select all the "Rolls-Royce" cars from the dataset.
Select only columns "Engine HP", "Engine Cylinders", "highway MPG".
Now drop all duplicated rows using drop_duplicates method (you should get a dataframe with 7 rows).
Get the underlying NumPy array. Let's call it X.
Compute matrix-matrix multiplication between the transpose of X and X. To get the transpose, use X.T. Let's call the result XTX.
Invert XTX.
What's the sum of all the elements of the result?
Hint: if the result is negative, re-read the task one more time

Questions 7

Create an array y with values [1000, 1100, 900, 1200, 1000, 850, 1300].
Multiply the inverse of XTX with the transpose of X, and then multiply the result by y. Call the result w.
What's the value of the first element of w?.
